# default_steps_dir: (Optional) Fallback directory used when:
#                    1. No specific mapping is found for a test name
#                    2. A specific step is missing in the mapped directory
#                    Useful for shared step implementations across tests.
# default_steps_dir = tests/steps/version_1_0
#
# Specific mappings:
# Key   = Test flow name passed to defineIssuanceTest() / definePresentationTest()
# Value = Relative path to directory containing custom step implementations
#
# How it works:
# - Steps are first searched in the specific mapped directory
# - Missing steps are automatically searched in default_steps_dir
# - Only if not found in either location, default stub implementations are used
#
# Example: Map specific tests to their custom step directories
